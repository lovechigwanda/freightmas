=====================================================

1. Purpose of the Report

- Audience: Customers/clients of the freight business.
- Goal: Provide a detailed, client-friendly PDF summary of all “Clearing Job” records for a selected customer, with each job shown as a structured section (not a table of rows).
- Export: Generated via Python and Jinja2 HTML template, exported as PDF.

2. Filters (User Input)
-----------------------
- Customer (mandatory): Only jobs for this customer are included.
- Direction (optional): Filter by Import/Export.

3. Data Source and Logic
------------------------

- Fetch Logic:
    - Query all Clearing Job records matching the filters.
    - For each job, fetch all child rows from cargo_package_details.
    - Prepare a context dictionary for each job, including all required fields for the template.
**The report should only fetch jobs that are not yet complete or that were completed within the last 7 days.

5. Page Layout
--------------
- Header: Report title, company name, customer name, export date (no logo).
- Sectioned: Each job is a separate section (with a page break after each).
- Tables: Use tables for job info, container/cargo details, milestones, and notes.
- Styling: Clean, readable, client-friendly (Bootstrap-like or simple CSS).

6. Technical Flow
-----------------
1. User selects filters and clicks “Export PDF”.
2. Backend Python fetches jobs and child table data, builds a context dictionary.
3. Jinja2 HTML template renders the report using the context.
4. Frappe PDF utility converts HTML to PDF and returns it as a download.
